The following is only a selection of some of the major features we plan to implement in the near future. To get a more complete overview of planned features and current work, see the [Approzium issue tracker](https://github.com/cyralinc/approzium/issues).

## Cloud Platforms
Approzium currently runs on AWS as it uses the Security Token Service (STS) to authenticate applications. We plan to support the following cloud platforms soon.
- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure

## Databases
Approzium currently supports MySQL and PostgreSQL. These databases may be self-hosted, or a managed service such as AWS RDS and AWS Aurora. We plan to support the following databases.
- MariaDB
- Galera
- MaxScale
- Vitess

Let us know if you would like to see support for any other self-hosted databases and DBaaS platforms.

## SDKs
Approzium currently supports Python applications. We plan to add other SDKs for the following programming languages in upcoming releases.
- NodeJS/TypeScript
- Golang
- Java
- Ruby

## OpenTelemetry
Both the SDK as well as the Authenticator service will support OpenTelemetry for generating logs, metrics and traces for enhanced observability. This will enable seamless support for tools such as ELK, Prometheus, Datadog and New Relic.

## Secrets Managers
Secrets managers are used to store database credentials. Approzium currently works with Hashicorp Vault. We plan to add support for the following secrets managers in the future.
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- Kubernetes Secrets

## Authenticator
Authenticator currently runs as a single instance of a docker container or one of the supported architecture specific binaries. We’re working on a high availability (HA) deployment model involving AWS auto scaling groups (ASG) that can be spun up using a choice of Terraform script or CloudFormation template. For Kubernetes deployments, support for Helm 3 charts is being added.

Approzium eliminates blind spots in the diagnosis and tracing of complex performance problems within autoscaled microservices running on modern orchestration frameworks such as Kubernetes and AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). For example, all instances of an autoscaled microservice look alike from a database’s perspective. This makes it harder to attribute performance issues resulting from misbehaving queries, buggy service code and faulty cloud VMs to a specific microservice instance.

By providing richer execution context about each microservice instance, such as the service’s IAM role info, the EC2 instance id and hostname where it’s running, or its container/task id in dockerized environments, Approzium allows DevOps teams to quickly trace and resolve performance issues. This context is added to the existing logs, metrics and traces already being emitted by the microservice.

Approzium integrates with popular secrets managers such as Hashicorp Vault and AWS Secrets Manager for the storage of database credentials, and uses OpenTelemetry to make it easy to integrate with a wide variety of observability products, such as Prometheus/Grafana, ELK, Datadog and New Relic.
