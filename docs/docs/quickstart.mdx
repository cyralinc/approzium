title: Quickstart

This guide will show you how to:

- Deploy the Authenticator.
- Store database credentials in Vault to be retrieved by the Authenticator.
- Connect to a Postgres database through the Approzium Python SDK.

## Deploying the Authenticator

- Head to [our latest release](https://github.com/cyralinc/approzium/releases/latest)
- Choose the appropriate binary for your operating system, and run it with a set of commands like:

```
curl -LO https://github.com/cyralinc/approzium/releases/download/v0.2.0/darwin_amd64.zip
unzip darwin_amd64.zip

export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=root
./authenticator --disabletls
```

For availability, we recommend running the Authenticator in a long-running environment (such as an EC2 instance) rather
than in a short-lived environment (like in AWS Lambda).

### Storing Credentials in Vault

The Authenticator expects credentials for a single database user as a secret stored against the database user as the key.
The secret contains the database password and a set of IAM roles allowed to access the credentials in the following structure.

```shell
cat dbuser1-creds.json
{
    "dbuser1": {
        "password": "asdfghjkl",
        "iam_arns": [
            "arn:aws:iam::accountid:role/rolename1",
            "arn:aws:iam::accountid:role/rolename2"
        ]
    }
}
```

For database access to be granted to a caller, the caller's exact `iam_arn` must be listed, _unless_ the caller has assumed a role.
For assumed roles, either the role ARN or the assumed role ARN may be used to grant access.

Enable Vault KV Version 1 (see [Vault documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1) for more information).

```shell
vault secrets enable -path=approzium -version=1 kv
```

Put the secret at path `approzium/<DATABASE_HOST:DATABASE_PORT>` with your database user as the key.

```shell
vault write approzium/1.2.3.4:5432 @dbuser1-creds.json
```

## SDK Usage

### Python

Install the SDK in your client.

```shell
pip3 install 'approzium[sqllibs]'
```

Connect to your database as follows. (Note: TLS should **not** be disabled in production environments,
see [our Python guide](https://approzium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#approzium.AuthClient) for how to configure them.)

```python
from approzium import AuthClient
from approzium.psycopg2 import connect

# create an Authenticator client
auth = AuthClient('authenticator:6001', disable_tls=True)

# connect using Approzium's connect method without providing a password
conn = connect("host=1.2.3.4 user=dbuser1 dbname=mydbhost", authenticator=auth)

# use the connection as you typically would. very cool!
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('SELECT 1')
```

### Go

The Approzium Go SDK currently supports MD5 authentication to Postgres.

```
go get github.com/cyralinc/approzium
```

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/cyralinc/approzium"
)

func main() {
	// Create a connection to the Approzium authenticator,
	// because only the authenticator knows the password.
	authClient, err := approzium.NewAuthClient("localhost:6001", &approzium.Config{
		DisableTLS:      true,
		RoleArnToAssume: os.Getenv("TEST_ASSUMABLE_ARN"), // Optional.
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Now create a Postgres connection without a password.
	// We also support strings like:
	// "postgres://pqgotest:@localhost/pqgotest?sslmode=verify-full"
	dataSourceName := "user=postgres dbname=postgres host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable"
	db, err := authClient.Open("postgres", dataSourceName)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	rows, err := db.Query("SELECT 1")
    ...
}
```
