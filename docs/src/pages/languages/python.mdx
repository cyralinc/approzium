# Python SDK

Our Python SDK is designed to pull identity from your local environment. It currently supports:

  - Pulling an assumed role ARN from AWS EC2 instances that have been launched into a role.
  - Pulling an assumed role ARN from AWS Lambda functions that have been launched into an execution role.
  - Pulling a role arn from a local development environment where "`$ aws configure`" has been run.

It uses the well-known `boto3` library for pulling identity, and thus its behavior for parsing identity
is exactly the same.

## API Reference

You can find full Approzium Python SDK API documentation [here](api/python/).
